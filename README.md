### Colour Scheme

- `#0e1414` used for text, headings and borders in the game area.
- `#f2eaea` used for background colour of page.
- `#ffffff` used for background colour of game area.
- `#555555` used for background colour of popups.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/0e1414-f2eaea-ffffff-a9a9a9-555555-008000-ff0000) to generate my colour palette.
